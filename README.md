# Learnbook (WIP)
Project by: Ahmed Khalil, Mehmet Akif Ã‡evik, Eda Aydemir, Hassan Fakih Osman.
Project for CMPE 331:"Software Engineering Concepts" from Istanbul Bilgi University

For this project we mainly depended on Flask as our main web framework and MongoDB as our database.
This platform is mainly designed for students of Bilgi University to use, it wouldn't apply for other universities.

## Core Features:

1. Student Profile Page/Dashboard:
    - Allow students to create accounts and profiles with their details.
    - Profile pictures and personal information.
    - Following clubs or other students.
2. Study Groups:
    - Facilitate the formation of study groups for specific courses or projects.
    - Enable students to post questions, share resources, and engage in discussions.
    - Allow users to upload and share study materials, notes, and textbooks.
    - Allow group admins to create custom tags to help filtering/finding the information required. (possible feature to be implemented)
        
        > Custom tags can only be created by the group admin can only be used within the searching group. Tags like: #html, #java, #cpu can be initiliazed only for that group. If we want to add a search functionality this makes the solution simpler. So when posting, students can pick a tag and it can be searched by other students like how dictionaries work.
    - Create discussion boards for different topics or courses.
    - Student organizations like student clubs.
3. Messaging and Notifications:
    - Implement a messaging system for private and group chats.
    - Send notifications for new messages, upcoming events, and other important updates.
